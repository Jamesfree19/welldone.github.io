<h1>Hello world!</h1>
<p>This is the first file in my new Git Repo.</p>
<p>Sometimes in life a man needs to be strong to show himself strong</p>
<p>For this is the basic principle that guide the life of the strong, not that at times they themselves do not experience hardtime, but one thing they do is that they let go of their weakness
    and embrace strength that comes from within
